> **Warning**
>
> Melon is **NOT** production-ready yet, the project is currently being developed and being battle-tested in different environments. Most of the required features, fixes and optimizations are not ready yet. Use in real-world projects at your own risk.
 
Melon is a JavaScript runtime focused in keeping **clear**, **uniform** and **simple** internal functionalities. Differently from the average options,
Melon was designed to profit from *real parallelism* and *railway-oriented, functional programming*, with capabilities to manage threads in real-time,
create allocations and work efficiently to execute the algorithms properly.
