### [v1.5.0](https://github.com/MelonRuntime/MelonRuntime/releases/tag/v1.5.0)
`06/24/2022`

> Docker + async/await + RestAPI update

- `http.app` and `HttpApplication` codebase and types remade to accept callback functions instead of string unsafe scripts. Now, http applications will be internally identified with a `name` field, store the callback externally (instead of sending it to the C# core) and that callback will be called using the `name` reference, from the core, with a `_apps` wrapper inside the `http` module
- Developed integrated Dockerfile and implemented [path resolution/memory usage] fixes to enable Docker support in MelonRuntime projects. Currently, the available compatible pre-built Dockerfiles can be found in the [dedicated folder](https://github.com/MelonRuntime/MelonRuntime/tree/main/utils/dockerfiles/) (you can also create your custom ones)
- Implemented `async/await` proper support in projects generated by `npx melon new [path?]`. Manual projects still need bundling using babel preset env or similar to run.

### [v1.4.0](https://github.com/MelonRuntime/MelonRuntime/releases/tag/v1.4.0)
`06/22/2022`

> Internal methods + utility update

- Complete refactoring of the `npx melon [args]` command execution module, improved display of return data for final logs and standardization of paths to find files
- Implemented `std.object` section, focused in object management operations, with the functions `isTruthy`, `isFalsy`, `isEnumerable` and the submodule `string` with the method `putAt`
- Implemented `environment.process` module with the functions `getMemoryUsage`, `getPlatform`, `setTitle` and `getCurrentTime`
- Implemented function `debug.details`

### [v1.3.0](https://github.com/MelonRuntime/MelonRuntime/releases/tag/v1.3.0)
`06/18/2022`

> Database update

- Implemented `data` MySQL and SQLServer raw providers (with methods `executeNonQuery` and `executeQuery`):

```ts
MySQLClient: function (host, port, database, username, password) {
  //...
},
SqlServerClient: function (host, port, database, username, password) {
  //...
}
```

### [v1.2.0](https://github.com/MelonRuntime/MelonRuntime/releases/tag/v1.2.0)

`06/11/2022`

- Implemented `application.baseDir()` function and types
