# ðŸ“° Running MelonRuntime on Docker

Currently, it is possible to run melon projects in docker, for this, the project must have a Dockerfile template
(customizable) that includes the ASP.NET 6.0 image and installs the latest NodeJS (which allows the execution of
NPM to perform of specific activities necessary for the execution).

- Using a pre-built MelonRuntime Docker API
- Clone the docker-api-melon repository
- Ensure that NodeJS and npm are installed and functional
- Ensure that docker is installed and running
- Execute the command npm run docker in the terminal repository root
- A new container will be created with the executing project
- The project may be running on http://localhost:3000
