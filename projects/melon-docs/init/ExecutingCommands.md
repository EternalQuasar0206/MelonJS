# ðŸ”© Executing commands

MelonRuntime's core is called from a console application, so a command must be executed
to promote its straightforward functionality, such as running scripts and loading projects.

Currently, MelonRuntime can be executed using:

```bash
npx melon [command] [...arguments?]
```

## Commands

- `npx melon` - Run in local console mode
