Welcome to **Melon** interactive documentation. In this summary you will find references to the standard libraries, tutorials, and resources to make learning and using the runtime easier.

## ðŸ”¥ Getting Started

Welcome to Melon! Melon is a .NET declarative JavaScript runtime that focuses on fast and reliable software development, always in a robust and scalable way. To get started, you will need to install [ASP.NET 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

> **Note**
> 
> `ASP.NET 6` is needed by Melon as core framework and `Node.js` is needed because it comes with `npm`, 
> that is needed to install, make and execute projects. These requirements are needed to execute the runtime
> in an easy way. You can also execute Melon runtime by compiling the source code.
