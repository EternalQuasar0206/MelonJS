# melon-types

This is a support package that contains all types (TypeScript) referring to `melon-runtime` features and modules. The package does not require any additional action to start using it in projects where it is manually installed or comes with the Melon create new project command.

## Contributing

All types of [contributions and improvements](https://github.com/MelonRuntime/Melon/pulls) will be accepted in the package as long as they reflect the same functioning as the internal `melon-core` package. This also goes for `melon-core` changes, which must reflect your `melon-types` functionality in order to provide the best development experience.
